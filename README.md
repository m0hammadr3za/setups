# Setups

This repository contains various setup configurations that I prefer to save and reuse for future projects. Each setup guide provides detailed steps to streamline the initial configuration of development environments, tools, and frameworks. The current available setup guide is for setting up a React project using Vite, along with styled-components, Storybook, and path aliases.
